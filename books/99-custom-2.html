Lesson 1:


Defining New Symbols 
</h1>
          
          
          

<article>

  <section class="development">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>You have a pocket calculator that can only do one thing —
    when you type in two whole numbers, it takes the first number,
    adds the second number to it, adds the first number to the sum,
    then takes that whole answer and multiplies it by the second
    number. The number you see on the screen is its final answer
    after this series of steps.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you type in 7 and 2, what will your calculator
      show?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What if you type in 2 then 7?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your friend uses the calculator. You can’t see the first
      number
      she types in, but the second number is 3. The answer that the
      calculator gives is 39. What was the first number?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>The calculator’s rule (from the problems above) has a symbol
    to represent it: “$\triangle$”.
    For example, “$7\triangle2$” refers to what you did in question #1.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is $2\triangle10$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is $2\triangle y$, in terms of $y$? Simplify as much as possible
      (no parentheses in your answer).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is $x\triangle8$ ?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is $x\triangle y$, in terms of $x$ and $y$? Write this as an
      equation.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you invented the symbol “$\triangle$” for a
    math problem you wrote, and wanted to explain it in an equation
    rather than in words, you would say:</p>

    <p>“Let $x\triangle y$ _______________________” (your answer to question
    7).</p>

    <p>This is called the algebraic rule for $\triangle$.</p>

    <p>Here the word “Let” is used the same way as when a problem
    says “Let $x$ be the number of boxes you purchase.”</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>After trying out a few different whole numbers as inputs
      to the $\triangle$ rule,
      John makes the following claim: “To get an odd number for
      your answer from $\triangle$, you need to input odd numbers for $a$ and
      $b$.”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Does John’s claim seem reasonable
      to you? If it doesn’t, find a counterexample — a specific
      example which proves that his statement is not always
      true.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is John’s claim true?</p>
    </div>

    <p>These two questions are quite different — in many
    situations, there can be a variety of different predictions
    that seem reasonable, but only one of them may be actually
    true! The habit of seeking proof is not only about learning how
    to prove a statement to be true — it’s also about learning to
    ask “Why would that be true?” when you are presented with a
    reasonable statement.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The symbol “&amp;”, applied to two whole numbers, means
      that you take the first number and then add the product of
      the numbers.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $4{\rm{\&amp; }}{\kern 1pt}
      {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} 7$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $7{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt}
      {\rm{\&amp; }}{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\rm{4}}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write an algebraic rule for
      &amp;.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Here is another of John’s claims.
      “To get an odd number for your answer from $a{\kern 1pt}
      {\kern 1pt} {\rm{\&amp; }}{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt}
      b$, you need to input an odd number for $a$ and an even
      number for $b$.”
      
      Is his new claim true? If you think it is true, carefully
      explain why.
      
      If you believe it’s not true, give a counterexample.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Just like any symbol regularly used in mathematics
      ($+ , - , \cdot , \div $), symbols that we create can be
      used inside
      an equation.
      
      Let $m \unicode{x263c} n = 3n - m$. Calculate the following:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$5\unicode{x263c}2$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$6 \cdot (5\unicode{x263c}2)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$(1\unicode{x263c}3.5)$$- {\rm{ }}(3.5\unicode{x263c}1)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$2\unicode{x263c}(3\unicode{x263c}5)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$(2\unicode{x263c}3)\unicode{x263c} 5$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$(a\unicode{x263c}b)\unicode{x263c}c$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In problem 10, is $m \unicode{x263c} n = n\unicode{x263c}m$ true in general, for
      ANY input numbers $m$ and $n$? Explain.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Problems</h2>

  <section class="problems">
  <h2>Problems</h2>
    <div class="problem">
      <p>When you give $\unicode{x00a9}$ two numbers, it gives you the
      third number in the addition/subtraction pattern. For
      example, $\unicode{x00a9}\left\{ {21,23} \right\} = 25$ (going up
      by $2$’s), and $©\left\{ {95,90} \right\} = 85$ (going
      down by $5$’s).</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $\unicode{x00a9} \left\{ {6,11} \right\}$ and $\unicode{x00a9} \left\{ {11,6} \right\}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $\unicode{x00a9}\left\{
      {11,\unicode{x00a9}\left\{ {6,11} \right\}} \right\}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write an equation for
      $\unicode{x00a9}\left\{ {m,n} \right\}$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>When you give $\unicode{x24}$  two numbers, it gives you the third number
      in the multiplication/
      division pattern. For example,
      $\unicode{x24}\{3,15\} = 75$, and $\unicode{x24}\{48,24\} = 12.$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $\unicode{x24}\{2,3\}$, $\unicode{x24}\{12,13\}$, and
      $\unicode{x24}\{102,103\}.$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $\unicode{x24}\{2009,1\}$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If $\unicode{x24}\{x,2\} = \unicode{x24}\{3,1\}$, then what is
      $x$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The symbol ¤ takes a single number, squares it, and then
      subtracts 4.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is ¤(6)?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Can you ever get a negative answer
      for ¤($x$)? Why or why not?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find an $x$ so that ¤($x$) is
      divisible
      by 5.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let the symbol $\unicode{xa5}$ mean: Add up the
      two numbers, then take that answer and subtract it from the
      product of the two numbers. What is $5\unicode{xa5}8$?  $8 \unicode{xa5} 5$?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Look back at the problem above. Do you think the same
      thing would happen for any pair of numbers, if you used the
      same symbol? Explain your answer.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When switching the order of the input numbers never has an
    effect on the answer, the symbol you are working with is said
    to have the commutative property. For example, the symbol $\unicode{xa5}$
    (from
    questions 15 and 16 above) had the commutative property, but
    the symbol © (from question 12)
    did not.</p>

    <p> One important thing to note is that there's no such thing as "sometimes" having the commutative property. For example, $\unicode{xa5}$ has the commutative property because
    $a\unicode{xa5}b$ and $b\unicode{xa5}a$ are equal for ANY
    input numbers $a$ and $b$, not just because it worked for 5 and
    8.</p>

    <p>Proving a statement false is as easy as finding one
    counterexample, but it is sometimes difficult to prove that a
    statement that appears to be true is indeed true. In the
    following problems (17-21), you will need to decide whether
    statements are true or false, and to also clearly support your
    position.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Fergie claims that each of the following symbols has the
      commutative property. Examine each of his claims.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$x{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern
      1pt} {\rm{\$}}{\kern 1pt} y$ means add 1 to $y$, multiply
      that answer by $x$, and then subtract $x$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Take two whole numbers $x$ and $y$.
      To do $x{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\rm{\% }}{\kern

      <p class="problem-part">$\unicode{xa2}$ takes two numbers.
      You reverse the first number (for instance, 513 becomes 315);

      of the two numbers — for example, $4 \unicode{x2605} 3 = 7$ which equals $4 + 3$. If
      it’s true, justify your claim. If

      claims that $\unicode{x24c7} \enspace$ is commutative. Is he correct?</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>To determine Felix’s driving route, you probably recognized
    a way to represent the situation visually — whether you
    sketched out a map or drew a diagram.</p>

    <p>The second and third problems, however, didn’t have an
    obvious new representation
    to apply. Some people probably applied labels; others may have
    made lists. It turns out, though, if we use the method of the
    first problem with the second and third, we can learn much more
    from the data!</p>

    <p>Most likely, the diagram you used in the first problem was
    actually a graph. A graph, in its most general sense, is a
    collection of dots (called “nodes”) and lines connecting them
    (called “edges”). In your graph of Felix’s problem, the nodes
    represented cities, and the edges related the nodes by showing
    the distances between.</p>

    <p>We can represent the second situation with a graph, too, if
    we let each country be represented by a node. We can draw an
    edge between nodes when those countries border each other. Our
    graph comes out to look like this:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/mid%20east%20graph.png"
      alt="mid%20east%20graph.png">
    </figure>

    <p>The problem now becomes to color each dot in such a way that
    any two dots connected by lines are always different
    colors.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the minimum number of colors you need now?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Did you think this version of the “coloring” problem was
      easier than in the introduction? Why or why not?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Similarly, we can represent the scheduling problem as a
    graph. The nodes can represent classes, and an edge can connect
    the nodes in the cases where some student wants to take both
    classes, as in the figure below.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/schedule%20planar.png"
      alt="schedule%20planar.png">
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve the scheduling problem using this representation.
      What minimum number of blocks can you identify now?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Was this version of the schedule problem easier than in
      the introduction? Why or why not?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The tools you have been using so far in this lesson are the
    tools of graph theory.
    Already, graph theory has been über-useful in helping us
    represent relationships in a very streamlined way. What’s more,
    we can now see that the map-coloring problem and the scheduling
    problem — initially very different — are actually remarkably
    similar.</p>

    <p>In fact, the identically structured graphs of the
    map-coloring problem and the scheduling problem are isomorphic.
    Two graphs are isomorphic when each node in one graph has a
    “partner” node in the other — a “partner” with the same
    connections. For example, Georgia in the first graph and
    Astronomy in the second correspond to one another. So do
    Lebanon and Advanced Calc. This correspondence comes from their
    identically structured connections, not their actual position
    on the page.</p>

    <p>The following two graphs are not isomorphic.<br></p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/Not isomporphic.png">
    </figure>

    <p>An easy way to see that the graphs are not isomorphic is to
    see that node B has no “partner.” In the left hand graph, B has
    three edges coming out of it. On the right, no node has three
    edges coming out of it, so B has no possible “partner.” The
    number of edges connected to a node is a very important
    characteristic. The degree of a node (abbreviated deg(n)) is
    the number of edges coming out of it. So in the left-hand graph
    deg(A) = 1 and deg(B) = 3. What is deg(C)?</p>

    <p>Isomorphisms can be trickier to spot than we’ve seen so far.
    For example, someone else with the task of drawing the
    scheduling graph might have come up with the following:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src=
      "../images/05-1-graph-theory/nonplanar schedule.jpg" alt=
      "nonplanar schedule.jpg">
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Check to see if this graph is still an accurate
      representation of the scheduling problem. Explain, in
      language a sixth-grader could understand, what you need to do
      to check if two graphs are isomorphic.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One final important concept that we will use is planarity.
    In the second
    version of the schedule graph, some edges crossed at places
    other than nodes. (For example, the edge connecting Animal
    Behavior to Shakespeare crosses the edge connecting Astro to
    Discrete.) In these cases, you can think of the edges passing
    under or over each other.</p>

    <p>Graphs where you don’t have to do this — where there is a
    way you can draw them without crossing the edges — are called
    planar.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why do you think the word “planar” might be used?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Note that a graph might be drawn with the edges crossing,
    and yet be isomorphic to a graph that is clearly planar, as in the following
    two graphs (with pairing 1-d, 2-a, 3-b, 4-c):</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/planar.png" alt=
      "planar.png">
    </figure>

    <p>In this case, we still say the first graph is planar because
    it can be drawn with no edges crossing and still represent the
    same information. Imagine picking up nodes 1 and 2, with their
    edges still attached, and “uncrossing” them to get something
    with the same shape as the second graph.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw a nonplanar graph.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find some degrees of nodes in the Middle East graph.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is deg(Saudi Arabia)?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is deg(Syria)?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What country’s node has the
      highest degree?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A shelter needs to find homes for nine cats. The table
      below indicates with an “x” which pairs of cats do not get
      along. Assuming that cats who do not get along cannot go with
      the same family, what is the minimum number of families
      needed to adopt all of these cats?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">A hundred nodes?</p>

      <p class="problem-part"><i>n</i> nodes?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now that you know how the number
      of nodes and edges in a complete graph are related,
      investigate this relationship further.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Are the number of nodes and the
      number of edges in a complete graph related directly? That
      is, if you double the number of nodes, does the number of
      edges double, too?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Are the number of nodes and edges
      in a complete graph related linearly? Or does the number of
      edges go up “faster” or “slower” than in a linear
      relationship?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the minimum number of nodes needed for a graph with
      1000 edges, if at most one edge can connect two nodes, and no
      edge can connect a node to itself?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If a complete graph has 500 nodes, can you estimate the
      number of edges quickly? Is it more likely to be roughly
      12500, 125000, or 1250000 edges?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the complete graph with four nodes, pictured earlier,
      the graph is drawn so that some of the edges crossed.
      However,
      just because it is drawn that way in that particular diagram
      does not mean the graph is not planar.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is the complete graph with four
      nodes planar?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is the complete graph with five
      nodes planar?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How about complete graphs with more
      than five nodes?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The symbol “Deg,” as in the degree of a node, represents a
      function. What kinds of objects does Deg take as input? What
      kinds of objects does it output? By the way, the set of
      allowable inputs to a function is called its domain, and the
      set of allowable outputs is called its range.</p>
    </div>

    <p>For the next seven problems, it will be useful to change the
    representation of the problem using the tools of graph theory.
    The first question to
    ask yourself is always, “what should the nodes
    represent, and what should the edges represent?”</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>As you learned last year, factoring a number means
    expressing it as the product of two or more other numbers. For
    example, 40 can be factored as $2 \cdot 20$. Of course, 40 can
    be factored in many other ways as well.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What are all the ways that 40 can be factored into two
      whole numbers?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since 20 can be factored as $4 \cdot 5$, 40 can also be factored into 3
    numbers as $2 \cdot 4 \cdot 5$; and since 4 can also be
    factored into $2 \cdot 2$, 40 can be factored into 4 numbers as $2 \cdot 2
    \cdot 2 \cdot 5$. You might also think of saying it could be
    factored into
    5 or 6 numbers as $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$ or $1
    \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$, but since those
    aren’t really
    different from $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$, we will agree that
    1 won’t “count” as a factor in the following problems, even
    though technically 1 is a factor of every number.
    Thus, at this point, 40 can’t be “broken down” any more than $2
    \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$ (we are restricting ourselves to
    positive integers here, so we wouldn’t consider turning 5 into
    $2.5 \cdot 2$ or into $- 5 \cdot - 1$).</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find two different ways to factor 72 into two positive
      integers. For each of your answers, continue factoring
      them until they can’t be “broken down” any more. Finally,
      rearrange each of your final factorings so that the factors
      are in order from smallest to largest.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Factor 210 into the product of as many positive integers
      as possible. Compare your answer with a classmate’s. Based on
      this question and on question 2, what generalization might
      you now conjecture?</p>
    </div>

    <p>A number has been factored as much as possible when each of
    its individual factors cannot be broken down any more. Numbers
    greater than 1 that cannot be broken down any more (i.e.,
    cannot be factored into smaller positive integers) are called
      <em class="vocab">primes</em>. We say that the <em class="vocab">prime factorization</em> of 40 is $2 \cdot 2
    \cdot 2 \cdot 5$, or ${2^3} \cdot 5$ for short; we know it is
    a prime factorization because all of the factors (2, 2, 2, and
    5) are primes. As suggested by questions 2 and 3, every
    positive integer greater than 1 has a unique prime
    factorization. As we will see, this uniqueness means that
    rewriting a number in its prime factored form will often be
    extremely useful, even though all we have done is written the
    same number in a different way.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it can be tricky to know what the factors of a
    number are: that is, what divides into it evenly, leaving no
    remainder. For example, what numbers is 153 divisible by? It
    would clearly be helpful if one knew easy procedures (known as
    divisibility tests) that allowed one to see if smaller numbers
    divided arbitrary larger ones evenly. As a matter of fact, the
    divisibility tests for 2 and 5 are easy (what are they?), but
    it helps to know the tests for 3 and 11 as well (sadly, there
    is no easy test for 7).</p>

    <p>If, when you add up the digits of a number, its sum is
    divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3 as well; on
    the other hand, if the sum is not divisible by 3, the number is
    not divisible by 3. So 14353 is not divisible by 3 (because $1 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 16$, 
    which is not divisible by 3), while 55521 is. We will learn why
    the divisibility test for 3 is true later this chapter, but you
    might find it fun to ponder why it works on your own first!</p>

    <p>Some of you may remember learning in 9th grade that a number
    is divisible
    by 11 only when the “alternating sum” is divisible by 11. So
    4565 is divisible
    by 11 because is divisible by 11, as is 527494 because $+ 5 -
    2 + 7 - 4 + 9 - 4 = 11$, but 6587 is not because $+ 6 - 5 + 8
    - 7 = 2$
    is not divisible by 11.</p>

    <p>And now, a few problems to check your understanding of the
    above:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the largest number (other than 495 itself) that
      divides evenly into 495? Why do you know it’s the largest
      number that can do so?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is 4806 prime? How about 4807? Quickly name 5 numbers
      between 4800 and 4900 that are divisible by 11.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Determine the prime factorization of 2310.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is 91 prime? How could you be sure of your answer?
      What about 221? Or 223?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with a procedure that can determine, with
      reasonable efficiency, whether a number is prime or not.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Determining in general if a positive integer is prime (i.e.,
    has no factors other than itself and 1) turns out to be an
    increasingly difficult task the larger the
    number becomes. In fact, one of the most powerful ways of
    encrypting data
    on the internet — the so-called “RSA algorithm” — is based on
    the difficulty
    of finding the prime factorization of very large (over 100
    digits!) integers.</p>

    <p>Prime factorization also allows us to determine the answers
    to questions about the relationships between two (or more)
    numbers. Remember that it can be helpful to write the final
    prime factorization using powers; for example, the prime
    factorization of 484 is ${2^2} \cdot {11^2}$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the largest number that divides evenly into both
      216 and 270? This number is called the greatest common
      divisor of the two numbers and is written as gcd(180, 156).
      (For example, gcd(24, 36) = 12, as 12 is the largest integer
      that “goes into” both 24 and 36.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If your answer to question 9 involved testing out a lot of
      different numbers, try writing out the prime factorization of
      each original number (i.e. 216 and 270) first and see if you
      can use them to be more efficient in finding their gcd.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find gcd(168, 448) efficiently. How can you be sure you
      have found the largest possible number that “works”?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find gcd(${2^{16}} \cdot {3^4}$, ${2^{13}} \cdot {3^8}$), or put another way, gcd(5308416, 53747712). Looking at the
      original prime
      factorizations of each number, what do you notice about the
      prime factorization of your answer?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Create a procedure that allows one to efficiently
      determine the gcd of two positive integers. Check it with 3
      examples that you make up, where at least one of the examples
      is similar to problem 12 (i.e., where the two numbers are
      large but have simple prime factorizations).</p>
    </div>

    <p>Crucially, then, a prime factorization is important because
    all the factors of a number derive from the number’s prime
    factors. 24, for example, is ${2^3} \cdot 3$,
    and all of its factors — 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 — are made
    up of combinations of the 2’s and 3’s found in the prime
    factorization.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the following exercises, learn how powerful prime
      factorization is by solving them without your calculator!</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How can you check to see if $32
      \cdot 35$ equals $28 \cdot 40$ without determining either
      product?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Juniper says that when she
      multiplies $6 \cdot 24 \cdot 55$ it is equal to $21 \cdot x$, where $x$ is an integer. Explain if she is telling the truth
      or not.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Simplify $\frac{{64 \cdot 25 \cdot
      14 \cdot 33}}{{28 \cdot 44 \cdot 15}}$ as much as
      possible.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is the positive integer N for
      which ${22^2} \times {55^2} = {10^2} \times {N^2}$?<br>
        Copyright <a href="www.mathleague.com"><em>www.mathleague.com.</em></a></p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is ${6^4} \cdot {10^3}$ greater
      than, less than, or equal to ${8^2} \cdot {15^3} \cdot 6$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The last few problems also are a reminder of the laws of
    exponents that you learned in middle school. Since ${5^6}$ is
    just $5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5$ and ${5^4}$ is
    just $5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5$,
    it makes sense that</p>

    <p>$\begin{array}{c} {5^6} \cdot {5^4} = (5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5
    \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5) \cdot (5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5)\\ =
    {5^{10}} \end{array}$</p>

    <p>Similarly, because $\frac{{{5^6}}}{{{5^4}}}$ is just
    $\frac{{5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}}{{5 \cdot 5
    \cdot 5 \cdot 5}}$, it makes sense that some pairs of 5’s in
    the numerator and denominator would “cancel” (because
      $\frac{5}{5} = 1$) and thus<br> 
      $\frac{{{5^6}}}{{{5^4}}} = \frac{5
    \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}{5
      \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}$<br> 
      $= \frac{5
    \cdot \cancel5 \cdot \cancel5 \cdot \cancel5 \cdot \cancel5 \cdot 5}{\cancel5
    \cdot \cancel5 \cdot \cancel5 \cdot \cancel5}$<br> 
      $= 5^2.$</p>

    <p>Lastly, ${({5^4})^3}$ is just $(5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5)(5
    \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5)(5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5)$, so
    ${({5^4})^3} = {5^{12}}$.</p>

      <p>Now let’s apply what we’ve learned in question 32.</p>


    <p class="problem-part">.

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here are a couple more doozies based on what you learned
      in question 33. Don’t use a calculator!</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What simple number is equivalent
      to
      ${\left( {{3^2} \cdot {7^4}} \right)^4}{\left( {{5^8} \cdot

    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You know from the laws of exponents that , or that
      ${x^a}{x^b} = {x^{a + b}}$. We can use this identity to
      help us think of square roots in a different way — as an
      exponent.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What does $(\sqrt x )(\sqrt x )$ equal?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">So if $\sqrt x = {x^N}$, what
      must $N$ be?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If $p \cdot p \cdot p = x$, what
      must p equal, in terms of $x$? Put
      another way, if we say that $p = {x^N}$, what does $N$
      equal?

      (This number is called a “cube root” of $x$, i.e., since $2
      \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$, 2 is a cube root of 8. This can also
      be written as $2 = \sqrt[3]{8}$, where the $\sqrt[3]{{}}$ symbol indicates “cube root”.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If ${p^5} = x$, what would p equal
      in terms of $x$? That is, if we say that $p = {x^N}$, what
      does $N$ equal?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If $p = \big(\frac{1}{32}\big)^{(\frac{1}{5})}$, what would $p$ be? If $q =
      \sqrt[5]{{\frac{1}{{32}}}}$, what is $q$ ?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">In general, then, if $\sqrt[n]{x} =
      {x^N}$, how are $N$ and $n$ related? Give a specific example or
      two to clarify.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using what you learned in question 35, simplify each
      expression as far as possible. No calculator necessary,
      although feel free to check!</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\left( {{{16}^{\frac{1}{2}}}}
      \right) + \left( {{{16}^{\frac{1}{4}}}} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${64^0} + {64^{\frac{1}{3}}} +
      {64^{\frac{1}{2}}} + {64^1}$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\left( {\sqrt[3]{{241}}}
      \right)\left( {{{241}^{\frac{1}{3}}}} \right)\left(
      {\sqrt[3]{{241}}} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\big(81^{\frac{1}{4}}\big)^{-2}$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${125^{\frac{1}{3}}} \cdot {36^{ -
      \frac{1}{2}}}$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You now know how to calculate
      ${64^0},\;{64^{\frac{1}{3}}},\;{64^{\frac{1}{2}}},\;{64^1}$ and ${64^2}$. Let’s broaden our horizons even more!</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Suppose a friend told you that he
      had just figured out how to calculate ${64^{1.5}}$. Based on
      what you already know about powers of 64, about how big a
      number do you think this is? Explain.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${64^{1.5}}$ can also be written as
      ${64^N}$, where $N$ is a simple
      fraction. What is $N$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now further rewrite ${64^N}$ by
      using the property of
      exponents that tells us we can rewrite ${x^{12}}$ as ${\left(
      {{x^3}} \right)^4}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Using your result from part c, you
      should now be able
      to compute a precise answer to ${64^{\frac{3}{2}}}\;( =
      {64^{1.5}})$.
      What is it, and does it agree with your answer in part a?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Similarly, what would
      ${64^{\frac{2}{3}}}\;( = 64\overline {^{.666}} )$ equal?
      How about ${4^{2.5}}$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Finally, what is ${7^{1.3}}$?
      Explain what it means to raise a
      number to the 1.3 power. Once you’ve done that, do the same
      for ${7^{1.29}}$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>One can also solve equations quite easily when they
      contain powers. For example, ${x^3} = 11$ can be solved by
      taking advantage of the laws of exponents and raising
      each side to the 1/3 power: ${\left( {{x^3}}
      \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}} = {11^{\frac{1}{3}}}$, the idea being
      that because the exponents on the left side multiply, the
      exponent becomes “1”, and so it simplifies to $x =
      {11^{\frac{1}{3}}}$ (or $\sqrt[3]{{11}}$).

      Solve the following equations for $x$, keeping in mind the
      strategies in the paragraph above:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^5} = 32$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^{\frac{1}{5}}} = 32$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$3{x^3} = 81$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\frac{16}{64}x^5=8$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^{\frac{2}{3}}} = 9$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^{2.71}} = 126$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$5x^{3.87}=1000$</p>

    <h2>Introduction: Hey batta! Hey batta!</h2>

    <p>Jan bats .500 in softball — i.e., on average, for each 10
    at-bats she gets five hits. We wish to determine the
    probability that she will get no hits if she comes to bat 5
    times during a game. In order to calculate this probability we
    must assume that she stays a “.500 hitter” from one at-bat to
    the next, which is to say that success or failure at each
    at-bat is not affected by the previous at-bats. Given this
    assumption we can perform the following calculation:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the probability that Jan will get exactly one hit
      in 5 at-bats?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the probability that Jan will get exactly 4 hits in
      5 at-bats?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the probability that Jan will get exactly 2
      hits?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The last question probably took some time to calculate since
    there are 10 different ways for Jan to get exactly 2 hits. For
    example, one string of at-bats might look like HNHNN, where H =
    “hit” and N = “no hit”. Imagine trying to calculate the
    probability that Jan would get exactly 3 hits in 10 at-bats.
    Don’t do this by listing all the strings of 10 at-bats with 3
    hits. You will be cursing by the end of this process, if not
    earlier. Fortunately, there is a more elegant way of counting
    how many strings have exactly 3 hits in 10 at-bats. Let’s look
    at one approach.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>This approach will require us, first, to review two basic
    counting principles that you learned last year. Suppose you’re
    setting up a password for a new account.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the password must be 3 letters followed by 3 digits,
      then how many possible passwords are there? The password is
      not case-sensitive so there’s no distinction between “a” and
      “A”.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the password must be 3 letters followed by 3 digits,
      but no letter or digit can be repeated, then how many
      passwords are there? Again, the passwords are not
      case-sensitive.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the password must be 10 digits, no letters, with no
      repetition, then how many passwords are there? There’s a nice
      shorthand way of writing this answer. Do you remember it?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The problems above involve a basic principle of counting
    called the Multiplication Principle of Counting. You also
    needed to pay attention to whether repetition mattered. Lastly,
    Problem 6 alludes to some shorthand notation that comes in
    handy when the final count gets very large. Keep in mind that
    this is only notation and doesn’t solve problems for you. As
    you progress through this lesson, you’ll need to remember that
    the formulas you might derive are not all-purpose ones that
    solve counting problems. They tend to work in highly
    specialized situations. You will find more success if you read
    each problem carefully, think about what is being counted
    (visualize, even), and then apply basic principles like the
    Multiplication Principle of Counting. Now, let’s see how to
    tackle the batting problem by looking at a similar problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The word error has 5 letters in it, two letters that
      appear once and one that appears three times. We’re going to
      look at different 5-letter “words” that can be formed by
      rearranging these 5 letters. These words need not make any
      sense, so “rroer” is a word.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many 5-letter words can be
      formed, assuming that you can tell the difference between the
      $r$’s? In other words, think of the $r$’s as being a red $r$, a
      blue $r$, and a green $r$ (or as ${r_1}$, ${r_2}$, and ${r_3}$). By the way, each of the letters can only be used once per
      word.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write down two 5-letter words that
      differ from each other only if the $r$’s are different colors.
      How many other 5-letter words differ from these two only if
      the $r$’s are different colors?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Think of another 5-letter word that
      is different from the ones in Part b. How many versions are
      there of this
      5-letter word that are distinguishable from each other
      only
      if the $r$’s are different colors? Would all of these 5-letter
      words be part of the count you made in Part a?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">So, how many 5-letter words can be
        formed by rearranging the letters in <em>error</em>, if each letter
      can only be used once per word (and the $r$’s are
      indistinguishable from each other)?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Lastly, you should be able to write
      your answer to Part d in the form $\frac{5!}{n!}$. What is $n$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many distinguishable 9-letter words can be formed from
      the letters in freestone, where each letter can only be used
      once per word?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many distinguishable 9-letter words can be formed from
      the letters in freewheel, where each letter can only be used
      once per word?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many distinguishable 9-letter words can be formed from
      the letters in appraisal, where each letter can only be used
      once per word?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the letters H, H, H, H, H, N, N, N, N, N, N, N only,
      how many 12-letter words can be formed? (Note: though the
      word “distinguishable” is not appearing you should
      assume you are just counting words that are different from
      each other.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the previous problems you were always counting letters.
    If you think about what you were doing, however, you should
    realize that the method of counting wasn’t dependent on
    letters. Problem 11, for example, could have initially been a
    problem about how many ways can you step right five times and
    left seven times in a sequence of twelve steps.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Bill is flipping a coin 8 times, keeping track of the
      sequence of heads and tails. What is the probability that
      he’ll get
      exactly 5 heads in total? Exactly 4 heads? 3 heads?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Alix’s mathematics class wants to form a committee of 4
      students to investigate whether AP classes should be taught
      in the school. If there are 16 students in the class then how
      many different committees can be formed?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The last problem may have seemed quite different from the
    previous ones, but there is a way of seeing it as no different.
    Imagine that you’re working with all 16 students and that you
    have 16 Velcro labels. Twelve of these labels are a large N and
    four of them are a large Y. You line the 16 students up and
    then try to count how many different ways you can assign the
    labels to the students. In this sense, you are trying to
    determine how many different ways you can arrange 12 N’s and 4
    Y’s in a sequence.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The answer to the last sentence (and to Problem 13) can be
      written in the form $\frac{{a!}}{{b!{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt}
      {\kern 1pt} c!}}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ have specific meanings
      in the context of the problem. What are $a$, $b$, and $c$ and what
      are their meanings?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The fraction in Problem 14 can be simplified so that there
      is only one factorial expression in the denominator. Do
      this.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Look back at your answer to Problem 15 and remember that
    this fraction is an answer to Problem 13. Now, use your
    understanding of the relationship between this fraction and
    Alix’s committee problem to answer the following question.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You’re going to order a triple-scoop bowl of ice
      cream.
      If you plan on choosing three different types of ice cream
      from 8 possible choices, then how many different triple-scoop
      combinations are there?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In this lesson you have seen some problems where two
    different orderings of the same things are to be thought of as
    being different — e.g., the passwords 3857210964 and
    6710892534. In other problems, you’ve had to discount these
    differences — e.g., the triple-scoop combination of
    chocolate-vanilla-pistachio does not differ from the
    combination pistachio-chocolate-vanilla. As you work through
    the remaining problems in these lessons, bear in mind these
    distinctions. Some problems will fall into one category and not
    the other, while some will fall into both. And, of course, some
    will fall into neither.</p>

      ketchup). They will each order one of each type of
      topping.</p>

      <p>You have learned that any positive integer has a prime
      factorization of the form ${2^a} \cdot {3^b} \cdot {5^c}
      \cdot {7^d} \cdot {11^e} \cdot {13^f}...$, where the “…”
      represents the rest of the primes, and $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, $f$, and
      so on can each equal 0, 1, 2, 3, … . So for example, 360 is
      equal to ${2^3} \cdot {3^2} \cdot {5^1}$.
      
      Remembering that every possible factor of 360 comes from one
      of the possible combinations of these prime factors (e.g. $20
      = {2^2} \cdot {3^0} \cdot {5^1}$ and $90 = {2^1} \cdot {3^2}
      \cdot {5^1}$), and using the principles of counting that you
      learned studying combinatorics, determine the number of
      factors that 360 has. Note that 1 is considered a factor of
      360 in this problem, i.e. $1 = {2^0} \cdot {3^0} \cdot {5^0}$. (You might try answering for 84 instead of 360 if you want
