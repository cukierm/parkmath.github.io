      <p>Often a problem that can seem particularly
      perplexing can be solved by looking at it in a
      different way. Sometimes the best way to keep
      track of the different information and variables
      in a problem is to draw a picture of some sort,
      to visualize the information so that it is in a form that is
      easier to understand. You saw this last year as you solved a
      variety of problems, at times by constructing models, and at
      times by finding clever ways to visually represent things
      that at first seemed quite nonvisual.</p>

    <p>If you were told by a classmate that taking a cup of
    brackish lukewarm water three times a day for a month would
    heal your broken leg, you would probably laugh out loud. And
    even though your laughter might be a bit more subdued were the
    source of that statement the health segment of the evening
    news, I bet that you would nonetheless be quite skeptical. On
    many levels this would seem to you to be highly implausible,
    and so you might either absolutely dismiss it or yield to that
    nagging curiosity and check out some other sources.</p>

    <p>On the other hand there are a host of other more reasonable
    sounding claims that you might be prepared to let slide.
    Examples might include the claim that an increase in oil prices
    pushes a decline in the Dow Industrial averages, or that there
    is a strong correlation between wealth and SAT scores. It
    doesn’t seem unreasonable to hold a healthy skepticism for
    these as well.</p>

    <p>In the context of mathematics, to <em class="vocab">check for plausibility</em> is
    to routinely check the reasonableness of any statement in a
    problem or its proposed solution, regardless of whether it
    seems true or false on initial impression; to be particularly
    skeptical of results that seem contradictory or implausible,
    whether the source be peer, teacher, evening news, book,
    newspaper, internet or some other; and to look at special and
    limiting cases to see if a formula or an argument makes sense
    in some easily examined specific situations.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="problem-content">
  
      <p>Your classmate proposed traveling 240 miles to the beach
      at an average speed of 80 mph, and the next day traveling
      home at 40 mph. He pointed out that since you have an average
      speed of 60 mph, the total 480 miles there and back takes 8
      hours. Yet when you went to the beach, it didn’t take 8 hours
      round trip, even though you two drove at precisely the speeds
      he had proposed. Why?</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>It certainly seems at first glance that your classmate is
    correct, but just because a result seems superficially correct
    doesn’t make it so. When there is an apparent contradiction in
    a problem, it often pays to make a quick check or two to see if
    what is being said is plausible. For example, how long does
    each half of the beach trip take?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
      <p>Martin says, looking at the figure below, that the entire
      rectangle’s area divided by the area of the square inside is
      equal to $\dfrac {a} {b} + 1$. Melissa thinks that such a peculiarly
      simple answer is unlikely to be correct. Martin insists he’s
      right, and that in fact his formula would work for any values
      of $a$ and $b$ one might choose. How could Melissa check to see
      if Martin’s formula is at least plausibly correct?</p>

    </div>
    </div>

    <p>One particular way that we check the reasonableness of a
    solution to a problem is to examine special and limiting cases.
    In the problem above, what would those cases be? Well, one
    special case would surely be when $a=b$, because you could quickly determine the right answer and check if Martin’s formula is correct there. What about if we examined
    when “$a$” was small and “$b$” was large—say $a=1$ and $b=100$, or even $a=1$ and $b=10000$? Does Martin’s formula make sense in those
    cases as well? Can you come up with another limiting case, and
    see if his formula is plausible for that case as well?</p>

    <p>Once you have checked a solution for all the limiting cases
    you can think of, if it still seems like a reasonable solution,
    you might think about how to prove it always works yourself
    from first principles. Can you come up with Martin’s
    formula?</p>

      <p>If one looks at $y=x^2$ on the calculator in “ZOOM SQR” mode (so that the scale in

      quickly, that it will eventually become a vertical line.

      water would be needed to fill the pool, Tim computes the
      volume from the blueprint, which is $4 \text{ ft}^3$, and then he
      multiplies by the scale factor of 16 to get $64 \text{ ft}^3$ of water to
      fill the pool. Tim is a little unsure if that is the correct

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Hero of Alexandria came up with a formula to determine the
      area of any triangle based solely on the lengths of its 3
      sides. Below are 4 formulas, all of which purport to be
      Hero’s formula. In all 4 formulas, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the
      lengths of the sides, and $s$ is the semi-perimeter, which is
      equal to half the perimeter.</p>
    
      <p align="center">$Area = \left(s-a \right)\left(s-b\right)\left(s-c\right)$</p>

      <p align="center">$Area = \sqrt {(s)(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Which of these formulas do you think
    is the right one? Why?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Try seeing if the formulas give the
    kind of answers you would expect for various “common” triangles
    you have experience with.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Test to see if “extreme” triangles
    (ones with very large or small values of some of the sides)
    also give reasonable results.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What units do you typically measure
    area in? Does that also help you in deciding which formulas are
    most plausible?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Now pick the formula you are most
    confident is the right one. Does the fact that it has passed
    all your “tests” prove that it is correct? If so, explain why.
    If not, explain how you could become convinced that Hero was in
    fact correct.</p>

      is 7. Subtracting the mean from each of the numbers and
      adding those together gives us $-6+-4+-1+2+4+5$, which equals 0. Juniper is unimpressed, and
      says that you would always get 0, regardless of the 6 numbers
      you chose. Sassafras disagrees, and says it is highly
      dependent on choosing the right 6 numbers; for example, in
      this case, exactly 3 were above the mean and exactly 3 were
      below, and also there were no decimals to complicate matters.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>You’ve seen sine, cosine, and tangent before. In fact,
    you’ve even used them to find missing sides in triangles.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How would you define the sine of $\theta $ ? Cosine of
      $\theta $ ?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use careful construction of a triangle to find $\sin {37^
      \circ }$.
      Do not use the sine function on your calculator!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why can’t you use a construction to find $\sin {102^
      \circ }$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Even though we can’t construct a triangle to find the sine
    of ${102^ \circ }$, your
    calculator can tell you an approximate value! In this lesson,
    we will discover
    a new way to think about sine and cosine—a way that makes
    calculating the
    values of $\sin {102^ \circ }$, $\cos 1002^\circ$, and $\tan \left( { -
    {{10002}^ \circ }} \right)$ possible.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Most of the problems in this section require carefully drawn
    diagrams.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A wheel of radius one foot is placed so that its center is
      at the origin, and a pin on the rim is at (1, 0). The diagram
      below shows the wheel after it has been spun an angle
      ${\theta ^{}}$ in a counterclockwise direction.









</p>
 
<p><figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/07-1-circular-functions/diagram%204.tif.jpg" >
  </figure></p>

<p>      Now consider the function $P(\theta )$, which outputs
      the
      coordinates of the pin after the wheel has been spun an angle
      ${\theta ^{}}$ in a counterclockwise direction. So, for
      example, $P({0^\circ})=(1,0)$ and $P({270^\circ})=(0, - 1)$.
      Find $P(\theta )$ when:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {90^ \circ }$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {45^ \circ }$. Give an
      exact answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {30^\circ}$. Give an exact
      answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {57^\circ}$

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta $ is some measure between
      ${0^\circ}$ and ${90^\circ}$. (Your answer should be expressed in
      terms of $\theta $.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">For values of ${\theta ^{}}$ between ${0^\circ}$ and ${90^\circ}$, how are $\cos \theta $ and
      $P(\theta )$ related?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now, let’s consider angles greater than ${90^\circ}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Calculate $P(150^\circ)$, with P being the same
      position function as in question 4.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $P(253^\circ)$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Compare these values to the sine
      and cosine of $150^\circ$ and $253^\circ$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Using the diagram and your
      calculations, what do you think the tangent of $253^\circ$ is? The
      tangent of $150^\circ$? Check them on your calculator.</p>
    </div>

    <p>It is the convention for rotations that motion in a
    counterclockwise direction
      is considered <em class="vocab">positive</em>, while motion in a clockwise direction
    is considered
      <em class="vocab">negative</em>. So if our wheel is spun $57^\circ$ counterclockwise we would
    input $57^\circ$
    in our function $P(\theta )$, as we did in problem 1, but if
    our wheel is spun $57^\circ$ clockwise we would input $–57^\circ$ in our
    function $P(\theta )$. So the output for would be the
    coordinates of the pin after the wheel is spun $57^\circ$
    clockwise.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - 240^\circ )$. Give an exact
      answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - 2640^\circ )$. Give an exact
      answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - 237^\circ )$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\tan ( - 237^\circ )$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - \theta )$, where $0^\circ
      &lt; \theta &lt; 90^\circ $. (Your answer should be
      expressed in terms of $\theta $.)</p>

      <p>$P(46280^\circ ) = ( - 0.94, - 0.34)$. Without using the
      cosine button on your calculator, find the cosine of
      $44480^\circ $.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let $\cos \theta = - 0.4$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">For how many angles is that
      true?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many of these angles are
      between $–180^\circ$ and $360^\circ$?</p>

      and $\sin ( - 10^\circ )$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s revisit question 4, but with a wheel of radius 7
      feet
      instead of 1 foot. The wheel is still centered at $(0,0)$,
      and still with a pin at $(7,0)$. Let $Q(\theta )$ be the
      function which outputs the coordinates of the pin after this
      larger wheel has been spun an angle ${\theta ^{}}$ in a
      counterclockwise direction.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $Q(48^\circ )$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $Q(109^\circ )$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How would you define sine and

    <p>Surprise! There are actually three more trigonometric ratios

    <p class="Lesson---Subheading">The Leaning Tower of Pisa</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">

    </figure>

    <p class="Lesson---Narrative-text">The Leaning Tower of Pisa
    has been leaning almost since the onset of construction in
    1173. From ground to top, the tower is 183.27 ft along the
    lowest side and 186.02 ft along the highest side. The angle of
    slant of the tower—formed by its shorter slant height and the
    ground—is ${95.5^ \circ }$. An apocryphal tale states that
    Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), an Italian physicist,
    mathematician, and philosopher, dropped two cannon balls of
    different weights from the top of this leaning tower in trying
    to demonstrate that the descending speed of a falling body is
    independent of its weight.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>What is the distance traveled by an object dropped from the
    top of the Tower of Pisa, on its lowest side, when it hits the
    ground?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
    <p>What is the horizontal distance from the point where the
    object hits the ground to the base of the tower?</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The Tower of Pisa first acquired a slant after the third
    floor was built in 1178. More recently, in 1990, it was closed
    to the public because of safety fears. In fact, the tower was
    on the verge of collapse, and it was projected that it would
    have collapsed between 2030 and 2040. However, it has been
    straightened a bit, but still remains slanted (the tower has
    been reopened to the public). Thus, the angle of slant of the
    Tower of Pisa, $\alpha $, has been changing for centuries. The
    following is a sketch of the situation.</p>

    found the following expression.</p>

    <p>We follow the convention of labeling the angles of a
    triangle using capital letters, and the lengths of the
    corresponding opposite sides with the corresponding lower-case
    letters. For example, we may label A, B, C the angles of the
    triangle, and a, b, c the corresponding opposite sides, as in
    the figure below.</p>

    <p class="Lesson---Subheading">The Bermuda Triangle</p>

    <p>The “Bermuda Triangle” or “Devil’s Triangle” is an imaginary
    area located off the southeastern Atlantic coast of the United
    States of America, which is noted for a supposedly high
    incidence of unexplained disappearances of ships and aircraft.
    The vertices of the triangle are generally believed to be
    Bermuda, Miami (Florida), and San Juan (Puerto Rico.)
    </p>

    </figure>
    
    <p>One of the amazing stories from this triangle tells that an
    aircraft (A in the figure below) was 747.23 miles from the
    airport of Miami (M in the figure), on the line joining Miami
    and Bermuda, when its crew received an SOS signal from Cyclops
    (C in the figure), a ship located at a point on the line
    joining Miami airport and San Juan, which was sinking. Flight
    controllers at the airport were able to estimate the measure of
    $\angle AMC$ to be ${52^ \circ }$.</p>

      <img src="../images/07-2-law-of-sines-and-law-of-cosines/diagram%204.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p>Based on the previous story, Mr. Thomas Howard designed a
    problem for his mathematics class. The initial situation
    described in the story, however, contained more than the
    minimal information required to solve the problem; therefore,
    he divided the class into two groups, Group I and Group II, and
    gave each group a problem with different pieces of information,
    but the same goal to determine how many miles the aircraft had
    to travel through the purportedly dangerous Bermuda Triangle
    before reaching Cyclops.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Group I: Besides the general information described above, it
    is known that $m\angle C = {60^ \circ }$. What is the distance

    solution to this problem and explain how you arrived at your

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Group II: Besides the original and general information, it
    is known that the distance from Cyclops to the airport of Miami
    is 800 miles, as shown in the figure below. What is the

    Find a solution to this problem and explain how you arrived at
    your answer.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
    <p>In Problem 5, if the distance given were m and the one to be
    found were c, the problem could be solved in a similar way.
    Consider the more general triangle below.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/07-2-law-of-sines-and-law-of-cosines/image17.tif.jpg" >

    <p class="problem-part">Draw the altitude from A to side
    $\overline {MC} $, and prove that ${\dfrac {c} {\sin C}} = {\dfrac {m} {\sin M}}$. </p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Hint: If $h$ is the length
    of the altitude from A to $\overline {MC} $, find h in $\Delta {ADM}$ in
    terms of $c$ and $\angle M$. Then find $\sin C$ in $\Delta {ADC}$.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Now, prove that ${\dfrac {m} {\sin M}} = {\dfrac {a} {\sin A}}$</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>In group II, Rebecca noticed that if the measure of $\angle
    M$ were ${90^ \circ }$ rather than ${52^ \circ }$, the
    Pythagorean Theorem would guarantee that ${m^2} = {a^2} +
    {c^2}$. “However,” she said, “since $\angle M$ is less than
    ${90^ \circ }$, the Pythagorean relationship among $m$, $a$, and $c$
    must be adjusted.” This adjustment is the result that you are
    about to find in Part c of the following problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Consider the triangle in Mr. Howard’s problem in a more
    general form, as shown below, and prove the following.</p>

    <p>In part c of the previous problem, expand the square on

    identities that you have learned thus far to find an expression
    as simple as possible relating $m$ to $c$, $a$, and $\angle M$.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>As announced above, the expression relating $m$ with $c$, $a$, and
    $\angle M$ that you may have found in the previous problem is
    the adjustment to the Pythagorean relationship ${m^2} = {a^2} +
    {c^2}$ required when $m\angle M &lt; {90^ \circ }$. In a
    similar way, adjustments to the Pythagorean relationship
    relating $a$ to $m$ and $c$ as well as to that relating $c$ to $a$ and $m$
    may be needed when either $m\angle A$ or $m\angle C$ is not
    ${90^ \circ }$, as in the case illustrated above.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Consider the general triangle shown below.</p>

    <h2>Further Development</h2>

    <p>When the students in Mr. Howard’s class shared their
    findings (the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines) the
    information contained in these laws was considered “the key” to
    find missing side lengths or angles in any triangle, when basic
    information about the triangle is known. However, in reality in
    all the proofs only acute triangles—triangles with each of
    their three angles being less than ${90^ \circ }$—were
    used.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Regarding Mr. Howard’s problem, consider the following
    situation where $m\angle M = {142^ \circ }$.</p>

    <figure class="fig">

    </figure>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Does the proof of the Law
    of Sines (in Problem 7), or that of the Law of Cosines (in
    Problems 8 and 9), support the use of either of these laws to
    find $m$ in this triangle, which is not an acute triangle?

      Often times, a problem that seems to be hard may be
      simplified a lot by just drawing a diagram or adding a couple
      of lines—or even just points—to a diagram already in place.
      These additions (to the concrete situation given) are
        implemented to <em class="vocab">visualize</em> and better understand problems which
      may have been initially confusing. In the following problems,
      29 through 33, you will have the chance to use this

Lesson 1:


Getting Comfortable With Trig 
</h1>

  <section class="development">




    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In an earlier lesson, you learned how the trigonometric
    functions sine, cosine, and tangent were defined for angles
    other than those between 0 and 90 degrees. Here is a quick
    refresher.</p>

    <p>Imagine sitting at the edge of a merry-go-round with radius
    1 meter. You’ve set up a coordinate system with (0,0) at the
    center of the merry-go-round, and the point (1,0) is due east
    from (0,0). When the wheel starts to turn counterclockwise,
    your position is (1,0).</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the merry-go-round has rotated $42^\circ$ from its
      starting
      position, find the coordinates of your position.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the merry-go-round has rotated $200^\circ$ from its
      starting
      position, find the coordinates of your position.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This may be enough to remind you of the generalized
    definitions of sine and cosine. In the figure below, a “spoke”
    of a circle of radius 1 is drawn so that it makes a central
    angle of $\theta $ with the positive $x$-axis. The spoke
      intercepts the circle at the point $(x,y)$. The <em class="vocab"></em>sine of an
      angle $\theta $ is the $y$-coordinate of this point. The <em class="vocab">cosine</em>
    of $\theta $ is the $x$-coordinate of this point.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/10-1-getting-comfortable-with-trig/Lesson%201%20-%20graph%202.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the figure above, how would you define the tangent
      of $\theta $?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In middle school, you learned that $\sin \theta $ is
      defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite $\theta$ in a right triangle to the length of the hypotenuse. Where is the right triangle in the figure above,
      and what are the opposite and hypotenuse?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How would you determine the sine, cosine, and tangent of
      an angle using a circle with a different radius than 1?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The circle with radius one is better known in mathematical
    circles as the “unit circle.” You’ll want to draw it — or a
    circle with a well-chosen radius — almost every time you solve
    a trig problem.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Cecilia is on a Ferris wheel and notices that, when she
      has rotated about 143 degrees from due east, she is 24 meters
      west and 18
      meters above the center of the wheel. Use this information
      to
      approximate the sine, cosine, and tangent of 143 degrees.
      Then
      see how you did by asking your calculator for these
      values.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>For each diagram, find the sine and cosine of the angle
      $\theta $.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Problem 2 may have reminded you that whether the sine or
    cosine of an angle is positive or negative depends on which
      <em class="vocab">quadrant</em> the angle is in. This allows you to answer questions
    like the following.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Go back to your 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 triangles and think
      about positioning them on the unit circle.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Name all angles between 0 and 360
      degrees that have a
      sine of $\frac{1}{2}$.</p>

      degrees that have a

      degrees that have a

      solutions are there? How many solutions are interestingly
      different from one another?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Of course, you might also have to solve equations that don’t
    involve sines
    or cosines of angles in special triangles. For instance, if you
    had to solve $\sin \theta = .2531$, you would be forced to
    resort to the inverse sine function on
    your calculator.</p>

      <p>Draw the “wheel” again, and draw a spoke at the angle that

    <h2>Further
    Development</h2>

    <p>You’re used to measuring temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,
    but you also know that much of the world measures temperature
    using degrees Celsius. Similarly, the world uses miles and
    kilometers, ounces and grams, gallons and liters.</p>

    <p>When the Babylonians invented degree measure, they chose a
    360-degree circle for two reasons. One was that, since there
    are 365 days in a year, a degree would be very close to one
    day’s progress around the circular path they believed the sun
    made every year. Another reason is that 360 is divisible by
    lots of numbers, so
    we can describe a fourth, a sixth, an eighth, and a tenth of a
    circle as an integer number of degrees. (Try this with a 100
    degree circle and you’ll see it doesn’t work as well.)</p>

    <p>As time went on, though, mathematicians realized that the
    number 360 didn’t
    really have anything to do with circles, and in fact some of
    their calculations would be easier if they used a different
    system. This system was inspired by the close relationship
    between a central angle of a circle and the arc it intercepts.
    It was also inspired by the importance of the unit circle.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/10-1-getting-comfortable-with-trig/Lesson%201%20-%20graph%2023.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <p>Specifically, we’d like the measure of a central angle in
    the unit circle to be literally the same as the length of the
    arc it intercepts.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the circumference of the unit circle?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since a 360 degree “central angle” intercepts the entire
    circle your answer to Problem 24 will be the equivalent of 360
    degrees in our new system.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How much of a circle does a 180 degree central angle
      intercept? So, in this new system, how should we represent a
      180 degree angle?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Under this new system, what should we call the measure of
      an angle that intercepts a quarter-circle?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What should we call the measure of an angle that
      intercepts
      a sixth of a circle?</p>
    </div>

    <p>When you measure angles this way, you are measuring in
      <em class="vocab">radians</em>. (Try pressing the MODE button on your calculator and
    notice that there is a radian vs. degree option.) The next
    problems suggest a reason for the name.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many times does the radius of a circle “fit” around
      the circumference? (Hint: remember that the circumference of
      a circle is $C = 2\pi r$.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Say you have an angle that intercepts an arc on the unit
      circle equal to two of its radii. How many radians is that
      angle?</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you are about to solve an equation like $\sin \theta = \dfrac {\sqrt {3}} {2}$, you might not
    know whether to give your answer in degrees or radians. Your
    class should agree on which system to use.</p>
